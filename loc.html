      You should authenticate with Github to raise API rate limits from 60/hr to 5000/hr.
      To do so, <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications/new" target="_blank">create a new application</a> using the following values:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Application name:</strong> GitHub Lines of Code</li>
        <li><strong>Homepage URL:</strong> <em>your URL, e.g. http://localhost/ or https://icecreamyou.github.io/GitHub-Tools</em></li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> <em>up to you, or just leave this blank</em></li>
        <li><strong>Authorization callback URL:</strong> <em>this isn't used so just pick something like http://localhost/oauth</em></li>
      </ul>
      When you're done, you'll get a client ID and client secret.
      If you're setting up your own instance of GitHub Lines of Code, copy-paste those values into <code>config.js</code>.
      Otherwise, change the URL of this page to include the values like this,
      replacing <code>CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> with your corresponding tokens:
      <pre id="here">https://icecreamyou.github.io/GitHub-Tools/?client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET</pre>

      Note that "lines of code" by itself is a very weak measure of experience
      at best, and not an indicator of quality. Different programming languages
      have orders of magnitude different verbosity, and well-designed code is
      often less verbose than poorly-designed code. Additionally, this page
      counts comments, documentation, and other non-code text in its accounting.
      It also counts libraries included directly in a repository and
      automatically generated build files (for example, concatenated or
      minified JavaScript) so not all of the code counted here was written by
      the user in question.
